Each sub-folder analyzes the features of CWL against a category of patterns found in the Workflow Patterns Initiative's website.

- Control patterns
- Resource patterns
- [Data](data/README.md) patterns
- Exception Handling patterns
- Presentation patterns
- Event Log Imperfection patterns


Note: the WPI's definition of a workflow is much broader than the type of workflows CWL aims to describe.

CWL targets workflows made of command line tools with no real-time communication between steps nor outside services.
WPI's definition of workflows includes (business) process modeling which have many control-flow features.

Therefore these are not to be treated as "to do" lists for CWL, but a way to describ and demonstrate CWL's features and abilities in the larger workflow space.
